\begin{prob}[8.1, Binary minimum cost detection]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] Consider a binary hypothesis testing problem with a priori probabilities $p_0$, $p_1$ and likelihoods $f_{V\vert U}(v\vert i)$, $i=0,1$. Let $C_{ij}$ be the cost of deciding on hypothesis $j$ when $i$ is correct. Conditional on a observation $V=v$, find the expected cost (over $U=0,1$) of making the decision $\tilde{U}=j$ for $j=0,1$. Show that the decision of minimum expected cost is given by
        \[
            \tilde{U}_{\text{mincost}}=\arg\min_j\left[C_0p_{U\vert V}(0\vert v)+C_1p_{U\vert V}(1\vert v)\right]
        \]
        \item[(b)] Show that the min cost decision above can be expressed as the following threshold test:
        \[
            \Lambda(v)=\frac{f_{V\vert U}(v\vert 0)}{f_{V\vert U}(v,1)}\overset{\tilde{U}=0}{\underset{\tilde{U}=1}{\gtreqless}}\frac{p_1(C_{10}-C_{11})}{p_0(C_{01}-C_{00})}=\eta.
        \]
        \item[(c)] Interpret the result above as saying that the only difference between a MAP test and a minimum cost test is an adjustment of the threshold to take account of the cost. i.e., a large cost of an error of one type equivalent to having a large a priori probability for that hypothesis.

\begin{prob}
    Consider the following two equiprobable hypothesis:
    \begin{align*}
        U=0\quad:&\quad V_1=a\cos\Theta+Z_1,\quad V_2=a\sin\Theta+Z_2,\\
        U=1\quad:&\quad V_2=-a\cos\Theta+Z_1,\quad V_2=-a\sin\Theta+Z_2.
    \end{align*}
    $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are iid $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$, and $\Theta$ takes on the values $\{-\pi/4,0,\pi/4\}$ each with probability $1/3$.\\
    Find the ML decision rule when $V_1$ and $V_2$ are observed.\\
    \emph{Hint:} Sketch the possible values of $V_1$ and $V_2$ for $\bm{Z}=0$ given each hypothesis. Then, without doing any calculations try to come up with a good intuitive decision rule. Then try to verify that it is optimal.
